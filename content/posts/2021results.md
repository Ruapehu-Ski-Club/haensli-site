We were lucky to get to hold the 2021 Haensli Cup the weekend before New Zealand went into lockdown!

It was a great event, you can check the pictures out on the [RSC Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/RuapehuSkiClub).
A huge thanks to RSC Club Captain Catherine Gafa and everyone helping her leading up to the race, helpers on the day, and our members who made it such a success!
