#HAENSLI CUP 2015 - Rules of Racing

## The Chief of Race

The Chief of Race directs all preparation of the competition and supervises
the activities in the technical area. He summons meetings for
consideration of technical questions.
The Chief of Race organises and supervises the work of the gate
judges. He designates the gates each will supervise and places them in
position. At the end of the first run and the end of the race he will collect
the gate judges' control cards for delivery to the Referee.
He distributes, in good time, to each gate judge the material that he needs
(control card, pencil, start list, etc.) and be prepared to offer assistance
either to help keep the spectators off the course or to help maintain the
course, etc.

## The Start Referee

The start referee must remain at the start throughout the race.
He makes sure that the regulations for the start and the start
organisation are properly observed.
He determines late and false starts.
He must be able to communicate immediately with the Race Committee at all times.
He reports to the Chief of Race the names of the competitors who did not
start, have made false or late starts or other infringements.

## The Finish Referee

The finish referee must remain at the finish throughout the race.
He makes sure that all the regulations for the organisation of the finish
and the finish in-run and out-run are properly observed.
He supervises the finish controller and the timing in the finish area.
He must be able to communicate immediately with the Race Committee at all times.

## Timing

With electronic timing, the time is taken when a competitor crosses the
finish line and triggers the beam between the photo cells.
In case of a fall at the finish where the competitor does not come to a full
stop, the time can be taken without both of the competitor’s feet having
crossed the finish line.
For the registered time to become valid, the competitor must immediately
completely cross the finish line with or without skis. With hand timing the
time will be taken when any part of the competitor crosses the finish line.
The finish controller determines the correctness of passage across the
finish line.

## The Start Recorder

The start recorder is responsible for recording the actual start order of all competitors.

## The Finish Controller

The finish controller has the following duties:
Supervision of the section between the last gate and the finish
Supervision of the proper crossing of the finish line
Recording of the order of finishing of all racers who complete the course

## Start Procedure

No official or attendant who could possibly give an advantage to or disturb
the starting competitor may be behind him. All outside help is forbidden.
By order of the starter, the competitor must plant his poles in front of the
start line, or where indicated. The starter must not touch the competitor at
the start. Pushing off from the start posts or other aids is forbidden and the
competitor may start only with the help of his ski poles.

## Start Timing

The start timing shall measure the exact time the competitor crosses the
start line with his leg below the knee.

## Passage of the Gates

If a competitor misses a gate, he may no longer continue through further
Gates, unless he/she climbs back and both feet pass above the line between the two flags.

## Crossing of the Finish Line and Recording of the Times

The finish line must be crossed:
• with three pieces of ski equipment or
• with both feet in case of a fall in the immediate finish area. In this case
the time is taken when any part of the competitor's body or equipment
stops the timekeeping system.

## Re-runs

### Prerequisites

A competitor who is obstructed while racing must stop immediately after
the incident took place and apply to any member of the Jury for a re-run.
This claim can also be made by the team captain of the obstructed
competitor. The competitor should make his way to the finish along the
side of the course.

## Grounds for Interference

Blocking of the course by an official, a spectator, or other
obstruction.
Blocking of the course by a fallen competitor who did not clear the course
soon enough.
Objects in the course such as a lost ski pole or the ski of a previous
competitor.
Absence of a gate knocked down by a previous competitor that has not
been promptly replaced.
Other similar incidents beyond the will and control of the competitor, which
cause significant loss of speed or a lengthening of the racing line and
consequently affect the competitors time.
Malfunction of the timekeeping system.

Disqualifications
A competitor will be disqualified if he:
does not pass through a gate correctly or does not start within
the time limits defined.

## Protests

### Types of Protests

- Against admittance of competitors or their competition equipment,
- Against the course or its condition,
- Against another competitor or against an official during the race,
- Against disqualifications,
- Against timekeeping,
- Against decisions of the Race Committee

## Gate judges' Instructions

Every gate judge receives a check card with the following information:
Name of the gate judge
Number(s) of the gate(s)
Designation of the run (1st or 2nd)
If a competitor does not pass a gate (or a gate marker) correctly, the gate judge must immediately mark the following on the check card in the columns provided:
The (bib) start number of the competitor.
If the gate judge is responsible for more than one gate, then the gate
number where the fault was made.
The letter F (Fault).
A drawing of the fault committed (sketch map - essential).
The gate judge must also watch that the competitor accepts no outside
help (e.g. in the case of a fall). A fault of this nature must likewise be
entered on the check card.
The gate judge may advise the competitor “Back” (to indicate they must go back through a gate or back further through a gate), or “Go” (to indicate the competitor is good to continue), but must not offer any other assistance or advice or the competitor is disqualified.

## Correct Passage

A gate has been passed correctly when both the competitor’s ski tips and
both feet have passed across the gate line. The gate line for a GS course is the line between the 2 sets of poles of the same colour, and this line may be crossed in any direction to constitute correct passage.
If a competitor loses a ski, without committing a fault, e.g. not by straddling a slalom pole, then the tip of the remaining ski and both feet must have passed the gate line. This rule is also valid when a competitor has to climb back up to a gate.

In the event that a competitor removes a pole from it's vertical position
before both the competitor's ski tips and both feet have passed the gate
line, the ski tips and feet must still pass the original gate line (marking in
the snow).

If a competitor is obstructed during his run, he must immediately leave the
race course and report this to the nearest gate judge. The gate judge must
enter the circumstances of the incident on his check card and have this
available for the Race Committee at the end of the 1st or 2nd run. The gate judge must request the competitor in question to report immediately to the Finish referree or another Race Committee member.

Duties of the Gate Judge at the Conclusion of the Race
Each gate judge who has recorded a disqualifying fault or who has been
witness to an incident leading to a re-run must be available to the Race Committee until after the settlement of any protests.

Supplemental Duties of the Gate Judge
After the necessary entries have been made on his check card, the gate
judge must shift immediately to his other duties. He should attend to the
following :

Replace gate poles vertically
Replace knocked out poles in their exact positions
Keep the course clear.

If a competitor is obstructed during his run, he must immediately leave the
race course and report this to the nearest gate judge. The gate judge must
enter the circumstances of the incident on his check card and have this
available for the Race Committee at the end of the 1st or 2nd run. The gate judge must request the competitor in question to report immediately to the Finish Referee or another Race Committee member.
